As I near the completion of my studies at Harbin Institute of Technology, I have come to realize the great potential and impact of Robotics and Autonomous Systems in shaping the future of technology and society. It is with great enthusiasm that I express my desire to pursue my passion for this field as a member of your renowned Robotics and Autonomous Systems program.

During my academic journey, I have gained a solid understanding of engineering principles and the fundamental concepts that support robotics and autonomous systems. I have explored various aspects of this field, including perception, control, planning, and machine learning. These experiences have piqued my curiosity and motivated me to explore the cutting-edge of robotics technology.

I am fascinated by the application of robotics and autonomous systems to solve real-world challenges. My goal is to contribute to the development of innovative solutions that can improve efficiency, safety, and sustainability in industries like manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, and agriculture. I believe that pursuing a PhD/MPhil in Robotics and Autonomous Systems in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) will provide me with access to a rich ecosystem of research institutions, industry collaborations, and entrepreneurial opportunities. This will enable me to translate theoretical knowledge into practical applications.

I am excited to start the 2-month intensive lecture program on Robotics and Automation at HKUST as part of the MPhil program. This program will provide me with valuable insights, knowledge, and exposure to the latest advancements in the field. I believe this immersive experience will shape my research orientation and lay the foundation for my future pursuits in Robotics and Automation. It is pivotal.

After finishing the MPhil program at HKUST, I plan to become a top researcher and innovator in Robotics and Automation. My goal is to contribute to the advancement of technology and its practical applications. I am passionate about using my expertise to address real-world challenges and drive positive societal impact.

One of my primary objectives is to participate actively in research projects that push the boundaries of Robotics and Automation. I want to work with teams of experts from different fields, such as engineering, computer science, and other domains, to create innovative technologies and solutions. My expertise in perception, control, and planning will help me contribute to the development of autonomous systems that enhance efficiency, safety, and sustainability in industries like manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, and agriculture.

I want to actively participate in the transformation of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) into a global hub of innovation and technology. To achieve this, I will leverage the unique opportunities available in the GBA to connect with industry leaders, research institutions, and entrepreneurs. Through these collaborations, I aim to bridge the gap between academia and industry. I hope to contribute to the technological advancements of the GBA and promote its global competitiveness by engaging with its vibrant ecosystem.
