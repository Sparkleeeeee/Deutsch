My name is Shitao Zou, and I am writing this motivation letter for the masterâ€™s program in e-mobility ACES (in English) at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. I am a fourth-year automation major and have mastered electronics and automation fundamentals, achieving a GPA of 3.6 . As I approach the end of my studies at Harbin Institute of Technology, my passion for the rapidly growing electric vehicle market has ignited. Specifically, I have developed a keen interest in electric car design and I am wholeheartedly committed to pursuing a career in this industry. With my bachelor's degree in Automation, which has strong ties to electric vehicle, I find myself captivated by the master's program in e-mobility ACES offered by FAU. 

My undergraduate studies in Automation encompassed a diverse range of subjects, including communication, signal processing, modern control theory, and theoretical mechanics. These courses have equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of the underlying principles and technologies that form the foundation of autonomous systems.

One of my undergraduate study focuses was machine vision, where I learned how to process complex signals received from optical sensors. This knowledge has equipped me with the skills to integrate machine vision technology into electric vehicles, laying the foundation for my exploration of autonomous driving technologies. Additionally, my undergraduate coursework included subjects such as theoretical mechanics, which has provided me with a solid foundation for studying vehicle engineering.

During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to work on a project that ignited my passion for electronics and sustainable development. Teaming up with a fellow computer science major who shared my interest, we embarked on building an agricultural robot capable of automatically detecting environmental information for precision agriculture. Throughout the project, I encountered various obstacles and elusive bugs, which required tireless dedication and perseverance to overcome. I vividly remember spending countless nights debugging code and troubleshooting hardware, fueled by an unwavering determination to bring our ideas to fruition. This experience not only deepened my technical skills but also instilled in me a sense of accomplishment and a desire to continue exploring the possibilities of advanced Electric Vehicle Engineering.

The specialization in AI & Autonomous driving  in the e-mobility ACES program particularly captivates me, as it encompasses the integration of artificial intelligence and advanced sensing technologies to enable self-driving vehicles. I am eager to delve into the development of robust algorithms, sensor fusion techniques, and safety systems that will pave the way for reliable and efficient autonomous transportation.

I firmly believe that your institution offers an exceptional platform for nurturing aspiring professionals in the automotive field. The program's emphasis on the ACES fields aligns perfectly with my career aspirations, and I am confident that the knowledge and skills I will acquire will enable me to make a meaningful contribution to the future of mobility.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the prospect of joining your master's program in  e-mobility ACES and embarking on a journey of innovation and sustainability in the automotive industry.
