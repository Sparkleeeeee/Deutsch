Dear HKUST (Guangzhou) Admission Committee, I am writing to recommend Shitao Zou for admission to the Research Postgraduate Programs at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). As an associate professor at Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), I have had the privilege of teaching, supervising, and guiding Shitao Zou for the past three years. I firmly believe he will be a competitive candidate.

Shitao Zou has demonstrated outstanding learning abilities in my classroom. He approaches learning with enthusiasm and possesses a strong sense of purpose and motivation. He consistently tackles academic tasks with great effort and dedication. Whether it is class assignments, project reports, or examinations, he consistently surpasses expectations and achieves excellent academic performance.

During the theoretical portion of the course, Shitao stood out for his enthusiasm and inquisitive nature. He actively participated in class discussions, asking insightful questions that demonstrated his genuine interest in the subject matter. Shitao's eagerness to learn and understand the underlying principles of the course was evident in his outstanding performance on assignments. He consistently completed assignments with excellent quality, showcasing his ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.

In particular, during the Automation Practice A course project, Shitao demonstrated outstanding engineering skills and the ability to work effectively with other students. He demonstrated a thorough understanding of the theory and principles behind the project and successfully translated them into a functional product. Shitao's project involved designing and building his own circuit board, and he demonstrated exceptional craftsmanship and attention to detail throughout the process.

I have no doubt that Shitao will continue to excel and make significant contributions in his future. Should you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.
