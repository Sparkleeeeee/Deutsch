Project Experience :
Developer for a smart wind tunnel. This project is a collaboration between the Shenzhen Technology University (SZTU) and Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT). The laboratory is located at SZTU and is overseen by my mentor, Bernd Noack.

Background and Objective:
Traditional physical wind tunnel experiments are an important means to study the aerodynamic characteristics of UAVs, but they face problems such as high cost, long experimental period and limited experimental conditions. 

The aim of this project is to design a smart wind tunnel. It offers greater flexibility, more functionality and lower cost than traditional wind tunnels. The wind tunnel system consists of a 40x40 fan array, where each motor can be controlled individually. By varying the operating speed of the motors, it simulates a wide range of wind-body motions found in nature. Furthermore, the smart wind tunnel systems are modular in design and can be flexibly adapted by the user as needed. The required footprint is small and can be flexibly assembled to meet the needs of low budgets and high flexibility.

Role and Responsibilities:
I served as a developer for both software and hardware. 

As for hardware, Â the motor matrix has been assembled by another team member and successfully linked to a DC power module. I took the responsibility of selecting a suitable microcontroller and utilized the IIC protocol to manage the PWM motor driver module, thereby regulating the speed of the 1600 motors. Additionally, I was assigned the task of developing a microcontroller program specifically for the STM32 platform. This program needed to effectively control the motor matrix while establishing communication with a personal computer (PC).

Regarding software development, I was tasked with the responsibility of creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) software for personal computers (PCs). The primary objective of this software was to facilitate control functionalities for different pre-established modes within the wind tunnel, such as gust mode and waving mode. Additionally, it aimed to provide real-time visualization of wind speed distribution in both spatial and temporal dimensions.

In addition, I conducted on-site testing of the wind tunnel system and perform on-site debugging. My team member, Yutong, provided feedback on any flaws in the software design, which I will then work on improving.

Work Approach and Schedule:
During the initial week, I researched a comparable product from a Swiss company named WindShape. The company offers a modular and scalable fan matrix that enables laboratory environments to accurately replicate and control wind conditions. However, it was observed that their product exhibited a prohibitively high cost and did not possess the claimed level of adaptability. After discussion, another member and I decided to deploy an STM32 as a lower-level controller and use a PC as a higher-level controller. By utilizing the computational power of PCs, we can significantly reduce costs and increase extensibility. Simultaneously, I read the book 'Low-Speed Wind Tunnel Testing' to gain a better understanding of traditional wind tunnel technology.

In the second week, notable progress was achieved as I accomplished the development and validation of the STM32 software, specifically tailored for a compact wind tunnel configuration comprising a mere 4x4 fan array. However, during testing at the SZTU lab, it was unsuccessful. Upon analyzing the situation with a logic analyzer, it became apparent that the failure was caused by the number of PCA9685 units (which are IIC-based 16-channel PWM generators) on the communication bus, as well as the length of the cables.  The unpredictable sequence of events led to the deadlock of STM32's CPU.

During the third week of my research, I discovered that the Software-defined IIC protocol could potentially solve the problem. Building upon this discovery, I embarked on the task of adapting a software-defined library, originally designed for the Arduino platform, to be compatible with the STM32 microcontroller. in the laboratory testing phase, the software exhibited highly satisfactory performance, effectively resolving the previously encountered issues. 

Following this accomplishment, my focus shifted towards advancing the PC software component of the project. By employing a state zone machine model, I ensured an efficient communication flow between the STM32 microcontroller and the PC. Using my knowledge of the Qt GUI Kit, I efficiently completed the Interface Layout according to the lab requirements.

The following month, the main task is to write logic code to make the software actually work. I soon realized that my knowledge of software engineering is too limited. I had to watch Youtube tutorials, read published essays, and browse open source forums while developing the software. To augment the overall functionality and flexibility of the application, I have integrated several new features and interaction logic. One notable addition is the implementation of a shortcut setting feature,  allowing the user to select frequently used wind modes and settings with a single click. Furthermore, I have focused on improving user interaction with the wind tunnel system by incorporating enhanced real-time feedback and status alerts. These additions aim to provide users with a more comprehensive understanding of the system's current state.

After the development process, the wind tunnel system was successfully deployed and utilized in Prof. Bernd Noack's laboratory. However, it became evident that there were areas for improvement to enhance its overall performance and functionality.
 I decided to rebuild the software with Flutter to provide better functionality, including programmable wind mode, visualized display, better user interaction and so on. It will also be my diploma project.

Outcomes and Impact:
The lab software is currently in use for drone testing. The wind tunnel system, equipped with the redesigned software, will provide valuable capabilities for testing and analyzing the performance of drones in controlled wind conditions.

I deeply realize the power and application of science and technology. They can bring great changes and progress to all walks of life. I am full of confidence in future technological development and innovation, and I hope to continue to participate in and contribute to the development of technology.

This project entails a student information management system comprising three sub-systems: student information management, student comprehensive assessment system, and student personal address book management system. These sub-systems facilitate information input, display, search, sorting, and addition. The project is implemented with a graphical interface and is based on the C++ programming language.
